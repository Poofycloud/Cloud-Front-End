        <p class="long-margin"> Andrew is a curious and creative thinker who always steps in with ambition and passion for the work he does. When he is not busy exploring the newest and greatest technology, he is involved with his fraternity, Alpha Kappa Psi - Epsilon Chapter, as the Director of Change and Development and active with the Fall 2021 Pledge Panel. In addition, he is on the executive board for the Cryptocurrency Society as the Blockchain Educator and Social Director. During the pandemic, his curiosity has led him to participate in LMU's New Idea Pitch Competition, where he had created a 5 minute pitch to a table of judges for an application idea called Helpr! He later applied the idea into practice at HackHealth 2021. </p>
